A small asp net core app, consturcted only to show paypal integration (which is by this time a bit deprecated, but))
Here, you can order some sluts for evening and pay for your order.
Stack used:
  -asp net mvc
  -entity framework with mssql server (database is automatically created and seed on start)
  -paypal api
Of course a bit of frontend on classical js with fetch api, and thats pretty all.
(Grabbing clientId and secret from appsettings won't give you anything, 'cause thats a sandbox account)
If you want an acoount to teest this, here you are: sb-mjttn37202268@personal.example.com | L!=c1vqw
Have a nice day
